At your request, I have uploaded my solutions here. No guarantee that the solutions presented here are correct. In addition, mostly the part of the code that was shown in class is nice, the rest of the code might be less beautiful and efficient. For example, if a heap is used for an algorithm like BFS, it is possible that the heap has not been perfected.
