At your request, I have uploaded my solutions here. No guarantee that the solutions presented here are correct. In addition, only the part of the code that was presented is nice, the rest of the code is less nice and efficient. For example, if a heap is used for an algorithm like BFS, it is possible that the heap has not been perfected.
